            I am a junior software developer with a background in quality
            assurance and the beverage industry. My experience in creating
            quality-driven products fused with my passion for continuous professional
            development has led me to becoming a developer. In honing my craft to build
            efficient and concise software, my goal is to create service-oriented applications
            that are fun, stylish, and easy to navigate for computer users of all levels. Beyond coding,
            I enjoy playing the uke, beer-brewing, cooking an [array] of dishes, and listening to my hubby’s
              vinyl collection.  </span>
