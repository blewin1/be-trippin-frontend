              I am a junior software developer with a background in quality 
              assurance and the beverage industry. My experience in creating 
              quality-driven products fused with my passion for continuous professional
              development has led me to becoming a developer. In honing my craft to build 
              efficient and concise software, my goal is to create service-oriented applications
              that are fun, stylish, and easy to navigate for computer users of all levels. Beyond coding,
              I enjoy playing the uke, beer-brewing, cooking an [array] of dishes, and listening to my hubby’s 
              vinyl collection.  </span>
